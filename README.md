# finance-tracking-app-server
Hello, everyone.

This is the code for the server-side of my Finance Tracking App (https://github.com/yordan-lyutskanov/finance-tracking-app).
I wrote it while learning the basics of Spring Framework and Spring boot. It is a very simple sever that syncs the data between my
Android app and a remote mySql database. It helped me learn the very basics of:

    - MySql Databases
    - Spring Boot
    - Spring Security
    - Spring Web
    - Hibernate
    
I hope you find it usefull and if you have any recommendations / suggestions how to improve it or you think there is something wrong 
with it feel free to share your concerns and teach me something new.

Thank you :)
